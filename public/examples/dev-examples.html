        Written in 'Dart' using the framework 'Flutter', this is a joint project
        between me and mentor, PT-Lam. The application can create, edit and
        store flashcards, with a question and answer sides. They can then be
        selected and used in a quiz game, as seen above.

        Written only in HTML, it is my current project, my actual first solo
        work and what you're looking at right now.
